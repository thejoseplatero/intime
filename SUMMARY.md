# InTime App - Current Status

## ✅ Issues Resolved

1. **Metro PNG Asset Errors**: Fixed by removing `@react-navigation` packages that had incompatible PNG assets
2. **LogBox Errors**: Resolved by using `LogBox.ignoreAllLogs()` (no `.setDisabled()` method in RN 0.82)
3. **React Hooks Violations**: Fixed by removing conditional hooks and properly ordering useState/useEffect
4. **DashboardScreen Undefined**: Fixed by removing reanimated dependency that was causing import issues
5. **Build Errors**: Resolved Metro cache issues by clearing .metro and node_modules/.cache

## ✅ Current Features Working

- **Onboarding**: Birthday picker with calendar date selection
- **Dashboard**: Displays milestones with countdown timers
- **Countdown Timers**: Live updating countdowns (years, days, hours, minutes, seconds)
- **Birthday Milestone**: Automatically created from onboarding birthday
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage persistence working
- **Navigation**: Simple state-based navigation without React Navigation

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Onboarding:
```bash
# Clear app data

# Rebuild
cd /Users/jj/intime && npx react-native run-android

# Check logs
adb logcat | grep "ReactNativeJS"
```

### Test Live Countdown:

2. Check dashboard shows birthday milestone
3. Watch countdown timer update every second
4. Verify days/hours/minutes/seconds decrease

## 📝 Known Limitations

1. **No React Navigation**: Using simple state-based navigation
2. **No Settings Screen**: Settings button (⚙️) exists but screen not implemented
3. **Simplified Animations**: Removed reanimated to fix compatibility issues
4. **FAB No Animation**: Removed spring animations from FAB button

## 🔧 Future Improvements

1. Implement Settings screen for birthday editing
2. Add back animations when reanimated compatibility improves
3. Add milestone editing capability
4. Add milestone deletion
5. Add custom emoji selection
